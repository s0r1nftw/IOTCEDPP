# IOTCEDPP
This repository contains the research replication package for the IOTCEDPP application.

The artefact was proposed in the conference paper “A Proof-of-Concept IoT-Enabled Digital Product Passport Application for the Smart Digital Circular Economy”, submitted to The 20th International Conference on Business Excellence – Driving Competitive Advantage through AI and Digital Ecosystems (26–28 March 2026).

The package includes the source code of the IOTCEDPP application, provided as an export of the Oracle APEX application, as well as a Postman collection used to simulate IoT product data for testing and validation purposes.
